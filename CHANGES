Version 1.2 (in progress)

  * refactor of runtime input parsing to use libGRVY; file is now read only
    once on rank0 and then distributed to remaining tasks for in-memory
    parsing (#87)
  * introduced a Solver base class and expanded top-level Tps class to
    setup Solver based on runtime settings; significant cleanup of top-level
    main() (#88)
  * updated primitive variable formulation to use pressure instead of
    temperature and introduce a GasMixture class (#90)
  * introduction of new axisymmetric flow solver-mode, CPU only (#98)
  * added a cylindrical source artificial heating term for energy equation (#105)
  * bug fix to include viscous terms in isothermal wall boundary condition
    (#100)
  * provide Python interface to top-level TPS:Tps class; build system updated
    to build a dynamic libtps.so support library; python bindings are generated
    using pybind11 and can be enabled via a new `--enable-pybind` configure
    option (#117)
  * update minimum version requirement for MFEM to be v4.3 (#132)
  * added a new [io] runtime option (restartMode = singleFileReadWrite) which
    will serialize the restart files for both reading and writing into a
    single .h5 file.  This is the recommended option when desiring to avoid 1
    file per MPI rank. (#138)
  * introduction of multi-component, reactive, 2T plasma models (#119, #121, #122, #126)
  * refactor gpu code path to reduce code duplication with cpu path
    (#128, #130, #131, #142, #146, #147, #149, #150, #152, #153, #155)
  * introduce 'cylce-averaged' coupling mode between EM and flow/plasma (#166, #167, #174)
  * introdece net emission coefficient (NEC) radiation model (#183)
  * add doxygen support (#186)
  * add code coverage (gcov+gcovr) support (#188)

Version 1.1 (21 Dec 2021)

  * addition of sponge zone boundary condition (#80)
  * addition of passive scalars for Navier-Stokes CPU-based solver (#82)
  * build system updated for MFEM, now provides a --with-mfem configure option
    that can be used to supply the top-level path for MFEM; macro will query
    required 3rd party libraries used with MFEM by scanning config.mk (#83)

Version 1.0 (19 Oct 2021)

  * initial release with standalone compressible flow and EM solvers
