Version 1.2 (in progress)
  * update primitive variable formulation to use pressure instead of
    temperature and introduce a GasMixture class (#90)
  * refactor of runtime input parsing to use libGRVY; file is now read only
    once on rank0 and then distributed to remaining tasks for in-memory
    parsing (#87)
  * introduced a Solver base class and expanded top-level TpS class to
    setup Solver based on runtime settings; significant cleanup of top-level
    main() (#88)

Version 1.1 (21 Dec 2021)

  * addition of sponge zone boundary condition (#80)
  * addition of passive scalars for Navier-Stokes CPU-based solver (#82)
  * build system updated for MFEM, now provides a --with-mfem configure option
    that can be used to supply the top-level path for MFEM; macro will query
    required 3rd party libraries used with MFEM by scanning config.mk (#83)

Version 1.0 (19 Oct 2021)

  * initial release with standalone compressible flow and EM solvers
